The original board, which I designed for Allison Dendy had a pull up SIP (4.7K) and second SIP (nominally 470 ohms) on the common anode to limit
current. Depending on the 3 lead Red/Green LED used the Red was significantly brighter than the Green. Green/Red brightness is always an issue as 
about 20% of males have some red/green color weakness, so adjustment is very individual.

This version has an additional DIP resistor pack in series with the Red leads to further limit the Red brigtness. I used A 220 ohm SIP for the common
anode and 1K for the red. This made the Jameco 2266591 LED appear about as bright on each side to me.
